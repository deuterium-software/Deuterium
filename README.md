Run `make`, or `make with-d-file` to install with a shorter prefix (d) along with the default dt prefix.

There should be a file named `dt` in `{project folder}/dist/`, alongside a file named `d`, if you wanted the shorter prefix.

If for any reason, there isnt a clone of these files in `/usr/bin`, then make sure to add them
  
After doing all these steps, Deuterium should be ready on your computer!
