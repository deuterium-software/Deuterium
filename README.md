## About
DeuTerium was created to quickly use the terminal, and compact long commands.

## How to use

Deuterium is meant to shorten everyday commands.

Lets start off with making a file. You can use the `dt` or `d` prefix:

`dt nf my_file.txt`
<br>
`d nf my_file.txt`

The format is:

`d/dt {command} {arguments...}`

See <a href="https://github.com/AregPrograms/Deuterium/blob/main/help.md">help.md</a> for all commands.

## Download
Check the latest release, and some installer executable files should be present. Once (or if) you find the executable right for you, install it and begin installing Deuterium.

If something goes wrong, follow these steps:

<details>

<summary>
  
Windows
  
</summary>
  
Once in __Administrator Mode__ (necessary to add program to C:\Program Files), run __make-windows.bat__.
  
When the program finishes executing, add `C:\Program Files\deuterium` to PATH, if not done automatically.
  
And thats it! That simple! 🎉

<summary>
  
Unix

Run `make`, or `make with-d-file` to install with a shorter prefix (d) along with the default dt prefix.

There should be a file named `dt` in `{project folder}/dist/`, alongside a file named `d`, if you wanted the shorter prefix.

If for any reason, there isnt a clone of these files in `/usr/bin`, then make sure to add them
  
After doing all these steps, Deuterium should be ready on your computer!
